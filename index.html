			So you want to go to Disney? You want to wait in long lines, buy overpriced mouse-shaped ice cream, and wear a mask in the heat <em>voluntarily</em>? If you say so - let’s plan a trip for you!
			</p>
			<p>
			First you’ll want to figure out which park you’d like to travel to. Disney Parks are located across the globe:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Disneyland Resort (Anaheim, California, USA)
				</li>
				<li>
				Walt Disney World (Lake Buena Vista, Florida, USA)
				</li>
				<li>
				Tokyo Disney Resort (Urayasu, Chiba, Japan)
				</li>
				<li>
				Disneyland Paris (Marne-la-Vallée, France)
				</li>
				<li>
				Hong Kong Disneyland Resort (Penny's Bay, Lantau Island, Hong Kong)
				</li>
				<li>
				Shanghai Disney Resort (Pudong, Shanghai, China)
				</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Seeing as how you’re liking reading this as a member of the LC101 community, your options are probably limited to parks located stateside. Also, seeing as how I’m the author, I’ll make the executive decision to choose Walt Disney World near sunny Orlando, Florida.</p>

				<p>Walt Disney World (Disney World or WDW for short) was created by Walter Elias Disney’s as the flagship resort for his then rapidly expanding enterprise. This was inspired by a thought he had as he watched his young daughters on a merry-go-round, wishing there was a place where parents could enjoy attractions with their kids in a family friendly environment. A successful media studio and initial theme park later, he decided to expand on his vision with more land than he could ever dream of in central Florida. In his lifetime he had designed the property’s first two parks, Magic Kingdom and EPCOT, with two additional staying true to his vision following his passing - Hollywood Studios (formerly Disney-MGM Studios) and Animal Kingdom.</p>

				<h2>Immersion and Prep Work</h2>
				<p>The magic of Walt’s vision is evident from the moment you enter the WDW property. You’re welcomed by a whimsical gate ensuring you know you’re entering the “Happiest Place On Earth,” with the effort to take you out of the daily grind of everyday life. Even the road signs are a different color to indicate this!</p>

				<p>To get the full experience out of your day, you should probably condition your body at least a month in advance. You will unknowingly walk 5-10 miles in a day, and don’t forget to consider the trek to and from the parking lot or back to your hotel! Be sure to pack sunscreen (yes, even in the winter), a reusable water bottle, snacks, and more topical - hand sanitizer! A little known fact about the Disney properties is that they do allow outside food and drink (non-alcoholic), so if you’re looking to curb your budget, consider calorie dense, shelf stable snacks such as trail mix, sandwiches, cookies (hey - I said calorie dense, not healthy!), or crackers just to name a few. Remember you’ll be throwing your bag all around, so pack wise! It’ll go under your seat, it may get sat or stepped on, and even wet given Florida’s unpredictable weather. </p>

				<h2>The Magic Kingdom</h2>

				<p>When “Disney World” is mentioned, the most common imagery that arises is the beautiful Cinderella Castle which lives in the heart of Magic Kingdom. Let’s plan a day there!</p>
				<p>Plan to arrive before park open. All your classic Disney pals put on a Welcome Show for those who arrive on time! After rope drop (what Disneyphiles call the official opening for each section of the park), try and head to the back of the park - either Fantasyland or Fronteirland. Reason being most first timers will work their way in the park, leaving attractions in the back with shorter lines the earlier it is in the day. If you’re traveling with little ones, my suggestion would be Fantasyland as they have the most toddler-friendly attractions. If you’ve got a kid who’s over 3’, you’re pretty set to do any and all attractions!</p>
				<p>Utilize the mobile app they offer to check on wait times. If you’re willing to miss the 3 o’clock parade or fireworks display, lines are shortest then! If you’re wanting to do character meet-and-greets, set some time aside to stop by their spots to get the exact time of their appearances. Character interactions are among the most sought after experiences in the parks, and they don’t hang around all day. Be prepared to wait in line for them as well. Remember some of them are royalty, they’ve got a lot going on!</p>
				<p>Remember I said Disney ensures an immersive experience? Don’t miss the small details as you make your way around! Cast member attire, unique totems, and even the types of lights and furniture they have!</p>

				<h2>The Magic is What You Make It</h2>
				<p>Honestly, there is no wrong way to take a Disney vacation. From the moment you step in, you are surrounded by the magic and passion of everyone there, from the showkeepers (what they call their housekeeping staff) to the princesses. It will be an experience you won’t soon forget!</p>
